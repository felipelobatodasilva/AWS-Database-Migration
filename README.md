# AWS-Database-Migration

For this migration, We'll use AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) and many other Services like IAM, EC2, S3 and RDS. 

All of these services mentioned recently can be used under AWS free tier which offers some different services from AWS for free, in order to explore many of them.

You can choose two different ways for the s3 bucket creation. The first one can be done either AWS Management Console or AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code.

At first, I will show you how to do it in both cases.
